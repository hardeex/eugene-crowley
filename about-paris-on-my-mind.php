                    <p>Paris On My Mind gives the truths of the past for its readers to become victors instead of victims over social conflicts. The first two chapters give the author's early connection with Paris since his hometown, St. Joseph, Missouri, had a French founder, Joseph Robidoux. After participating in a conference, "A Language To Dwell In: James Baldwin, Paris, and International Visions" at the American University in Paris in May 2016, the author wrote his book. Baldwin depended on religion and the wisdom of the past in confronting social ills. Blacks, Whites, young, and old can use the wisdom of the past to conquer their adversaries.</p>
                    <p>Eugene Crowley taught English grammar and World Literature for 32 years in Chicago's Public Schools. He has a master's degree in General Psychology. Mr. Crowley authored Upside Down World: The Loss of the Sacred Cosmos in 2009.</p>
                    <p>Born near the end of World War II in St. Joseph, Missouri, Eugene spent 32 years teaching mythology and wisdom to high school students in Chicago. He has traveled throughout the United States, Europe, and South America. His book, Upside Down World: The Loss of the Sacred Cosmos, aims to provide readers with the meaning of life through the lens of sacred cosmos. In 2016, Crowley spoke at a James Baldwin conference at the American University in Paris, France, and later wrote Paris On My Mind: Thoughts of Paris, James Baldwin, and Harlem. The book reveals Baldwin's views on racism, his observations, solutions, and consequences, urging readers to understand the truth to find their purpose in life.</p>

                    <p>I taught English grammar and World Literature for 32 years in Chicago's public schools. I retired in 2001 and later wrote <strong>Upside Down World: The Loss of the Sacred Cosmos</strong>. It was published in 2009. My second book, <strong>Paris On My Mind: Thoughts of Paris, James Baldwin, and Harlem</strong>, was published in 2020. My writings call attention to the basic truths that were practiced by past civilizations. PARIS ON MY MIND gives readers the purpose in life and how to attain it. Personal growth happens when we speak truth in all areas of our lives. The book recommends attaining self-knowledge with the awakening of our spiritual identity.</p>

                        <p>Racism on a global stage can be a touchy subject but now more than ever, it needs to be addressed. Aside from taking a closer look at James Baldwin’s life, how he defined racism and his coping strategies, Eugene Crowley stresses the importance of awakening the spiritual, not religious, part of our lives, similar to how past civilizations placed greater importance on the soul, which is divine in nature. In doing so, everyone, including blacks, whites, young, and old can use this wisdom to conquer their adversaries because when we rediscover our spiritual identity, we can live “more genuine, authentic, and peaceful lives.” This insightful and eye-opening book is full of history, soul searching, and useful advice, written in a language that everyone can understand and apply in their lives.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="carousel-item">
                        <p>Highlights include Chapter Three: The American Madness where the author writes that racial conflict is not the ‘Negro problem,’ but rather ‘The American Madness’ and Chapter Five: Dwelling in Languages where he discusses how James Baldwin’s harsh language sometimes led to criticism, but primarily because people find it difficult to confront their irrational behaviors. One final piece of practical advice he gives about life is, “The best solution for boredom is to become active. Life was not meant to be lived in one space.” Overall, “Paris On My Mind” is an excellent examination of James Baldwin's life and works and a gentle reminder that to live a more peaceful life, we should strive for a more spiritual existence. It is recommended for fans of biographies, personal growth, spirituality, and practical life advice.</p>
