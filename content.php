      <p>Paris On My Mind gives the truths of the past for its readers to become victors instead of victims over social conflicts. The first two chapters give the author's early connection with Paris since his hometown, St. Joseph, Missouri, had a French founder, Joseph Robidoux. After participating in a conference, "A Language To Dwell In: James Baldwin, Paris, and International Visions" at the American University in Paris in May 2016, the author wrote his book. Baldwin depended on religion and the wisdom of the past in confronting social ills. Blacks, Whites, young, and old can use the wisdom of the past to conquer their adversaries.</p>

    <h3>Book Review</h3>
    <p>Racism on a global stage can be a touchy subject but now more than ever, it needs to be addressed. Aside from taking a closer look at James Baldwin’s life, how he defined racism and his coping strategies, Eugene Crowley stresses the importance of awakening the spiritual, not religious, part of our lives, similar to how past civilizations placed greater importance on the soul, which is divine in nature. In doing so, everyone, including blacks, whites, young, and old can use this wisdom to conquer their adversaries because when we rediscover our spiritual identity, we can live “more genuine, authentic, and peaceful lives.” This insightful and eye-opening book is full of history, soul searching, and useful advice, written in a language that everyone can understand and apply in their lives.</p>
    <p>Highlights include Chapter Three: The American Madness where the author writes that racial conflict is not the ‘Negro problem,’ but rather ‘The American Madness’ and Chapter Five: Dwelling in Languages where he discusses how James Baldwin’s harsh language sometimes led to criticism, but primarily because people find it difficult to confront their irrational behaviors. One final piece of practical advice he gives about life is, “The best solution for boredom is to become active. Life was not meant to be lived in one space.” Overall, “Paris On My Mind” is an excellent examination of James Baldwin's life and works and a gentle reminder that to live a more peaceful life, we should strive for a more spiritual existence. It is recommended for fans of biographies, personal growth, spirituality, and practical life advice.</p>
